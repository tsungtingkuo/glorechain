### Introduction

This is the code for the GloreChain, which runs privacy-preserving batch predictive modeling algorithm on a permissioned blockchain network.

### Predictive Model

GloreChain is based on [GLORE](https://github.com/x1jiang/glore) modeling method.

### Example Data

The two sets of example data (Edin and CA) are derived from the two datasets included in [EXPLORER](https://kr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/39653-distributed-logistic-regression-using-expectation-propagation).
